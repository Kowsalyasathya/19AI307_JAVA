# Ex.No:3(A)  STRING AND ITS OPERATIONS IN JAVA
## AIM:
To create a java program to read input and print length of the string in java.

## ALGORITHM :
1.  Start the Program.
2.	Import `Scanner` and define class `demo`
3.	In `main`:
-	a) Create `Scanner` object `sc`
-	b) Read a line of text into `String` variable `str`
4.	Print "The size of the String is " + `str.length()`
5.	End




## PROGRAM:
 ```

   	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);  
   	String str = sc.next();

 
    	System.out.println("The size of the String is "+ str.length());
	}
}
```
